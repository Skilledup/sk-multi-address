## Installation

1. Upload the `sk-multi-address` folder to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
3. The plugin will automatically add a new "My Addresses" section to the WooCommerce My Account area

## Usage

### For Customers

1. Log in to your account
2. Navigate to My Account → My Addresses
3. Add new addresses using the form
4. Edit or delete existing addresses as needed

I recommend you to disable woocommerce own Addresses menu and use this plugin instead. go to WooCommerce → Settings → Advanced → Account endpoints and disable "Addresses" menu.
